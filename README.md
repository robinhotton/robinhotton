## 🎯 Current Focus

I’m currently working on an innovative educational tool designed to enhance the learning experience for my students:

### 📚 DigiLearn_IA
A smart teaching assistant, integrated with our future LMS (**Chamilo**), designed to:
- Assist students throughout their learning journey  
- Answer their questions
